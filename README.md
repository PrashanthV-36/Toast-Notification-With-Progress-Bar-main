# Toast Notification with Progress Bar

This project demonstrates a modern **toast notification system** with an integrated **progress bar** using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The toast notifications are lightweight, responsive, and visually appealing, designed to enhance user experience by delivering instant feedback messages in a clean and interactive way.

## ✨ Features

* 🔔 **Toast Notifications** – Display success, error, warning, or info messages.
* ⏳ **Progress Bar Animation** – Built-in timer that visually indicates when the notification will auto-dismiss.
* ⚡ **Auto-Close & Manual Dismiss** – Notifications disappear after a set duration or can be closed manually.
* 🎨 **Custom Styling** – Fully customizable colors, animations, and positions.
* 📱 **Responsive Design** – Works seamlessly across all screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Structure of the notifications.
* **CSS3** – Styling, animations, and progress bar effects.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Logic for triggering and dismissing notifications.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. A user action (like form submission or button click) triggers the toast.
2. The toast slides into view with a message and a progress bar.
3. The progress bar gradually fills to indicate time remaining.
4. The toast auto-dismisses when the progress ends or can be closed manually.
